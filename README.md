## About The Project

Mars Rover is a contest that was organized by Sololearn.

A rover is a space exploration vehicle designed to move across the surface of a planet, they can collect dust, rocks, and take pictures. This project allows us to simulate and visualize an
autonomous rover by implementing its CPM (Command Processing Module). The CPM allows us to control the rover remotely.
